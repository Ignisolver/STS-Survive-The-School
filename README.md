# STS-Survive-The-School
Program for pupils or students to help them manage their grades and frequences.
## Description
This is my first python project written in hihg school.
I need it becouse in my high school some subjects was very boring and in my opinion unusable. Participating this subjects I wanted to do only as much work as needed to pass them. I used to save my time and also participate only anough amount of lessons to have sufficient presence.
